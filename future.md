Future Plans
Looking Ahead

The Privacy UI Pattern Library is an evolving, research-led resource. While it currently focuses on mapping privacy-focused interface patterns to GDPR-related regulatory concepts, its longer-term aim is to grow into a broader design support tool that helps designers engage more critically and confidently with privacy-respecting interface design.

As privacy expectations, technologies, and regulatory landscapes continue to evolve, this library is intended to evolve alongside design practice—remaining adaptable, reflective, and grounded in human-centred design principles.

Toward an Open, Collaborative Resource

A key future direction is to explore how this library could transition into a more open and collaborative resource for designers. Over time, the goal is to enable designers, researchers, and practitioners to contribute insights, examples, and refinements informed by real-world design contexts.

Any future open contribution model would remain curated and moderated to:

Maintain research integrity and quality

Ensure relevance to interface-level design decisions

Support constructive, privacy-aware discourse

By encouraging shared learning, the library aims to foster a stronger privacy mindset across the design community while remaining intentionally scoped and governance-driven.

Expanding Regulatory Coverage

A major next step for the Privacy UI Pattern Library is to expand beyond GDPR-focused mappings to include additional privacy and data protection frameworks across regions and sectors. This expansion is intended to help designers recognize recurring privacy concepts across regulatory contexts and better understand how interface-level decisions may support privacy-respecting design practices.

Planned regulatory frameworks for future mapping include:

Europe

ePrivacy Directive (and proposed ePrivacy Regulation)

Industry and Context-Based Tagging

Future iterations of the library aim to incorporate industry- and context-based tagging to help designers more easily find patterns, examples, and templates that align with the specific domains in which they work.

Planned tagging dimensions may include:

Industry context (e.g., healthcare, finance, education, e-commerce, public sector)

Product type (e.g., consumer apps, enterprise tools, data platforms)

User sensitivity level (e.g., children, patients, financially vulnerable users)

Data context (e.g., health data, financial data, location data)

By enabling designers to filter patterns and examples by industry and context, the library aims to:

Improve relevance for real-world design scenarios

Support designers working in regulated or high-risk domains

Help bridge the gap between abstract regulatory concepts and domain-specific design decisions

This approach is intended to complement regulatory mappings, not replace domain expertise or legal interpretation.

Scope and Intent

Future regulatory and industry mappings will focus on identifying shared privacy concepts—such as transparency, consent, user control, data minimization, and access rights—and examining how these concepts may be reflected in interface-level design patterns across different contexts.

These efforts are intended to:

Support designers in understanding privacy expectations within their domain

Reduce cognitive and interpretive barriers when designing for privacy

Make privacy-by-design practices more approachable and attainable within everyday design workflows

This library does not provide legal advice or guarantee regulatory compliance. It is intended as a design support and research resource.

Ongoing Research and Iteration

The Privacy UI Pattern Library will continue to evolve through ongoing research, evaluation, and reflection. Future updates may include:

Additional validated patterns and sub-patterns

Expanded empirical and regulatory references

Industry-specific examples and templates

Community-informed questions and discussions

Iterative refinement based on designer feedback

By remaining research-driven and intentionally scoped, the library aims to balance practical usefulness with academic rigor.

A Shared Goal

At its core, the long-term vision of the Privacy UI Pattern Library is to help make privacy-respecting interface design more understandable, achievable, and embedded within everyday design practice—supporting designers as they navigate complex regulatory, ethical, and domain-specific considerations while creating meaningful, human-centred user experiences.
